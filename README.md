# Not A Watch
## Created by Thomas Kaldahl
### A simple programmable LED watch.

I wanted to put my engineering skills to the test by creating a programmable
watch that can tell time and date, serve as a stopwatch, and play some simple
games. The watch will be a custom printed circuit board that sits inside a
custom 3D printed chassis.

The watch is controlled by an ATtiny84 and will be powered by a lithium-ion
battery. The display will be an 8x8 LED matrix occluded by a mask that aids
readability of up to 4 alphanumerical characters on the screen at a time.

In addition to basic time telling and stopwatch functionality, there are two
games planned to be playable on the watch: snake, and 2 player connect 4.
