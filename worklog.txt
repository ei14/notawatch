====================================[ JUNE ]====================================
THU 11 - Would like to make a watch using integrated circuits on printed
	circuit boards. Would like it to tell time and date, serve as stopwatch, and
	play some basic games.
FRI 12 - Researched printed circuit board creation methods and compared homemade
	methods to various online vendors.
SAT 13 - Researched microcontrollers by Atmel. Compared microchips based on
	power consumption and functionality. Found PCB vendor with SMT.
SUN 14 - Continued microchip research. Attempted programming a simulated
	microcontroller. Researched KiCAD, a PCB design and schematic software.
MON 15 - Successfully simulated microcontroller. Settled on ATtiny84. Researched
	MAX7219. Located various obtainable components online for home prototyping.
TUE 16 - Researched Lithium Ion Batteries and compared capacities to the power
	consumption of the ATtiny84 and additional components. Designed stencil to
	overlay atop 8x8 LED matrix for readable numbers and letters. Made FreeCAD
	model of stencil for watch chassis.
WED 17 - Ordered ATtiny84 and MAX7219 online.
FRI 19 - Received ATtiny84 and MAX7219. Successfully wrote and executed a simple
	LED-blink program for the ATtiny84. Decided to replace MAX7219 with two
	74HC595 shift registers for convenience.
SAT 20 - Successfully controlled two 74HC595 shift registers using ATtiny84.
	Wrote a program that demonstrates full control over each pixel on an 8x8 LED
	matrix using the ATtiny84 and 2x 74HC595. Created a basic user manual for
	the watch. Ordered a set of crystal oscillators online.
SUN 21 - Downloaded and installed KiCAD. Started creating electronic schematic.
MON 22 - Created electronic schematic.
TUE 23 - Received crystal oscillators. Ordered a set of ceramic capacitors
	online.
WED 24 - Received ceramic capacitors. Added to the user manual.
THU 25 - Started designing PCB. Working on allowing the wires to all connect.
FRI 26 - Continued work on PCB design. Rearranged ports to allow for easier
	wiring.
SAT 27 - Continued work on PCB design. Used trial and error to find a working
	circuit and track arrangement.
SUN 28 - Finalized PCB.
====================================[ JULY ]====================================
THU  9 - Compared AVR C and AVR assembly.
FRI 10 - Settled on assembly. Researched AVR assembly.
SAT 11 - Created development environment for assembly coding and testing.
MON 13 - Continued research on AVR assembly. Began testing assembly code on
	simulated AVR.
TUE 14 - Created working time keeper function to track the amount of time
	elapsed between instructions.
